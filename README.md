# Full Stack Engineer Handbook
## Intro
Hi üëãüèª. 

My name is **Carlos Estrada**, I love **Technology**, **Programming** and **Entrepreneurship**. I graduated from college with Bachelors in **Electrical** and **Computer Engineering**. I went on to work in the **Aerospace industry** right out of colledge and later for the **Semiconductor industry**. I currently work as a **Salesforce Developer**.

The web has empowered us tremendously in many ways. The content out there for us to learn is incredible. So here is a path I'm taking to become a better **Full-Stack Engineer**.

I hope to inspire any upcoming engineer/dev out there.

### My Daily Routine
* Wake up 6:30 am
* Study from 7:00 am to 9:00 am
  * Currently Im studying for my 4th Salesforce Certification and programming in general.
  * Work on a **Coding Problem** in Javascript and in C++.
* 9:00am - 12:00pm work.
  * Due to **Covid-19** ü¶† I'm working from home, so no commute to work ü•≥ 
* Run 2 miles at noon. 
* 1:00pm - 5:00pm work.
* 5:30pm Crossfit üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* 7:00pm Study/Projects/Entrepreneuaship
* 9:30pm - 10:00pm start wynding down, otherwise I'll be too wired to sleep.
  * Read, meditate, whatever helps out.
  
**Note**: 
* I barely watch TV or play video games. I don't mind a good Series (Stranger things, The Mandalorian, etc...). But the problem I find with video games and TV is that after a couple of hours I feel that I didn't accomplished anything for my knowledge or wellbeing.

## Steps to Full-Stack Ninja
Enough chatting.
- [ ] [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244)
    * In my opinion the best bootcamp out in the web. The instructor [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) will take you from **Rooky** to **Pro** in this amazing course. For those who already have experience, it's still an amazing course to take.
- [ ] In parallel with the bootcamp above, start your own webpage.
    * I'll provide a link to mine soon.
    * Make sure to have a purpose (and I'll explain what I mean later).
