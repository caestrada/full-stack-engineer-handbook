# Full Stack Engineer Handbook
Hi üëãüèª. My name is **Carlos Estrada** and I love **programming** and the empowerment the web has given us. I graduated from college with Bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I went on to work for the Aerospace industry right out of colledge and later for the Semiconductor industry. I currently work as a Salesforce developer and I believe it's an amazing platform that is only getting better.
This is the path on becoming a better Full-Stack Engineer that I suggest. I have a passion for technology and learning. So I'll be showing the steps I took on becoming a Full-Stack ninja. 

### Steps
- [ ] [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244)
   * In my opinion the best bootcamp out in the web. The instructor [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) will take you from Rooky to Pro in this amazing course. For those who already have experience, it's still an amazing course to take.
