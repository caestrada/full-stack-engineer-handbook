# Full Stack Engineer Handbook
Hi 👋🏻. 

My name is **Carlos Estrada**, I love **Technology**, **Programming** and **Entrepreneurship**. I graduated from college with Bachelors in **Electrical** and **Computer Engineering**. I went on to work in the **Aerospace industry** right out of colledge and later for the **Semiconductor industry**. I currently work as a **Salesforce Developer** and I believe it's an amazing platform that is only getting better. 

The web has empowered us tremendously in many ways. The content out there for us to learn is incredible. So here is a path I'm taking to become a better **Full-Stack Engineer**, ... I don't know I might even do some **Machine Learning**. Clearly Im bored... 🤣.

I hope to inspire any upcoming engineer/dev out there. There is so much content that sometimes I question the need to go to University for an education (to pick up  girls yeah it's all worth it 🤪). Please stay in school and don't drop out!!!

   * In my opinion the best bootcamp out in the web. The instructor [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) will take you from **Rooky** to **Pro** in this amazing course. For those who already have experience, it's still an amazing course to take.
