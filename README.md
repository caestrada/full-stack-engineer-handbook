# Full Stack Engineer Handbook
Hi 👋🏻. 

My name is **Carlos Estrada**, I love **Technology**, **Programming** and **Entrepreneurship**. I graduated from college with Bachelors in **Electrical** and **Computer Engineering**. I went on to work in the **Aerospace industry** right out of colledge and later for the **Semiconductor industry**. I currently work as a **Salesforce Developer** and I believe it's an amazing platform that is only getting better. 

The web has empowered us tremendously in many ways. The content out there for us to learn is incredible. So here is a path I'm taking to become a better Software Engineer, Full-Stack Engineer, Mobile Engineer, ... I don't know I might even do some Machine Learning (🤪). Im bored...

This is the path on becoming a better Full-Stack Engineer that I suggest. I have a passion for technology and learning. So I'll be showing the steps I took on becoming a Full-Stack ninja. 

### Steps
- [ ] [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?referralCode=F2958B9D9447BDFC8244)
   * In my opinion the best bootcamp out in the web. The instructor [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/) will take you from Rooky to Pro in this amazing course. For those who already have experience, it's still an amazing course to take.
